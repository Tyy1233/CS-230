The game room client takes and receives game information and adds them to the director of games. The section I did particularly well was how the implementation of the corrected code went. The separation of the design sections was the easiest to work through taking on one section at a time made the job easy. The part I would revise for my paper would be the Pros and cons section with the evaluation for each operating system. I would like to examine windows verses Linux more. User interface was the number one thing looking at how they would interact with the software was the most important. This means that no matter what system they are on or what is add the effort is seamless. I always focus on one step at a time with my software this allows for each section to be correct before bring them all together to work as one.
